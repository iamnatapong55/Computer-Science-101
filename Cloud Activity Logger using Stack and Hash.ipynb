    "# Cloud Activity Logger Using Stack and Hash Map\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:** In cloud computing environments, it can be challenging to efficiently log, track, and retrieve the sequence of various operations, such as file uploads, query executions, and data pipelines. Managing these activities in real-time is crucial for maintaining organized workflows and ensuring quick access to relevant information. However, traditional logging methods can be inefficient and slow, especially when dealing with large-scale cloud operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Overview:** This project proposes a cloud activity logging system using two fundamental data structures: a Stack and a Hash Map. The Stack will maintain an ordered log of cloud activities in a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) manner, allowing for easy retrieval of the most recent operations. The Hash Map will store and retrieve detailed information about each operation efficiently, enabling constant time lookups. This combination ensures the system is optimized for real-time operations while remaining simple to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key data structures used:\n",
    "- **Stack**: To keep track of the order of cloud activities (Last-In, First-Out).\n",
    "- **Hash Map**: To store and retrieve detailed information about each operation efficiently (constant time lookups).\n"
